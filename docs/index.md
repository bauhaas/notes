# Bauhaas Notes

Hello there! Here are some of my notes.

## Why

I'm using this site to take notes on various topics.

I've tried multiple methods in the past. At first, before starting my developer journey i've used a skimpy system with Excel and `.txt` files. Then, i've tried to use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to centralize a bit more all the informations I wanted. Even if it helped me to bring more structure, with time, the navigation started to be more complex and the search system was not the most efficient.

I got this idea in my mind for a while now but never took the time to find a method that would fit my needs. Recently, I've mainly worked with Nestjs and I found that their [documentation](https://doc.nestjs.com/) is really well crafted. The way they structure their documentation is really efficient and I thought that it would be a good idea to take inspiration from it. Then, I came accross this [article](https://www.jesuisundev.com/le-developpeur-qui-sait-tout/). The way he structured his notes looks similar to what I was doing in Notion but with some additional features that I found really interesting. The final step to dive into this project, was when I found [Nikita Voloboev's wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/). Liked the idea to have a place for everything and dump your notes and ideas in a single place. Didn't heard about [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) before but it seems to fit with what I was looking for.

So, here I am. Let's see how it goes.

## Structure

Most of the pages under `dev`section are organized in the following way:

1. **Title**: The title of the page.
2. **Mental model**: One phrase to understand the idea or concept. Often a metaphor or analogy with a strong simplification.
3. **Preview**: Small paragraph to give a preview of the idea or concept. It should be simple to understand and easy to remember. Multiple sentences allow for more precision and limit simplifications.
4. **Details**: The main content of the page. It should be a complete and detailed explanation of the idea or concept
5. **Notes**: My personal notes on the idea or concept. It can be a summary, a reminder, a personal opinion, or a personal experience.
6. **Quizz**: A small quizz to test my understanding of the idea or concept. Using the balise `details` to hide the answer of each question. The goal is to force me to go look for the answer in my dumb brain.
7. **Links**: Links to resources that I found helpful.

The other pages are more free-form and can be organized in a different way.
