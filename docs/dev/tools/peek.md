# Peek

Simple animated GIF screen recorder with an easy to use interface. Declared as deprecated by the author in january 2023. Never meet any particular issue.

Neat and simple to use. I mainly using it for quick demos and to illustrate issues in MRs.

In his [deprecation announcement](https://github.com/phw/peek/issues/1191), the author recommends using [Kooha](https://github.com/SeaDve/Kooha) <Badge type="warning" text="need to test"/> as an alternative.

```bash
sudo apt install peek
```
